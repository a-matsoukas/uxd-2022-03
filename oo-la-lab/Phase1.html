							<h2>Project Proposal</h2>
							<p>
								Receipt Tracking for People, centered on Freelancers and Content Creators
							</p>
						</header>

						<p>
							<h3>What is the problem in brief?</h3>
							<br>
								Individuals who are self-employed or work in industries that are not formally recognized have a hard time understanding, tracking, and filing their taxes. 
								Most of the time these individuals are creatives and do not have any tools to understand what tax laws and brackets apply to them. Moreover, they do not 
								take advantage of the specific tax returns or write offs that may be available to them. And even if they are aware of the system, they need to keep track 
								of their daily expenses and understand how to divide personal expenses from business expenses. This is often done right before the tax deadlines, where 
								you submit all the receipts you can get your hands on to a tax consultant and wait for them to figure out what your final tax amount will be. However, 
								many creatives/freelancers who are starting out do not have the financial means to have an inhouse tax consultant. Apart from the logistical issues, 
								there is also a primary behavioral issue where individuals focused on creative work overlook their financial obligations. Building an app catered specifically 
								to this persona will provide them with an easy method to fulfill those responsibilities and, eventually, modify their behavior.					
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>How will your project change the status quo? For whom?</h3>
							<br>
								Our goal is that our product can help ease the process of filing taxes for individuals who would otherwise struggle and need to pay an external person to do them. 
								Moreover, it will establish a sense of ownership and responsibility as individuals learn to manage their finances and leverage tax systems. Also, in doing so, we 
								increase our own general knowledge of filing taxes on a personal and a micro scale.

						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>What is (at least) one naïve design idea (rough sketch)? How does this idea address what you see as the core problem?</h3>
							<br>
								We think the core problem is not knowing how your expenses and income look like over time, and how that reflects onto your taxes. Our design above aims to fix that 
								with easy to view solutions through graphs and easily digestible boxes of information. However, we decided to not add text to these boxes because we are not part of 
								our users, so we hope to talk to them and figure out what information they would want to be displayed here.

						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>What information do you need to collect? How will you collect it? How will you meet your target users, or who can serve as effective proxies for them?</h3>
							<br>
								<p>
								<b>Questions:</b>
									<ol type="A">
									<li>What users need this?</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Self-Employed / Freelancers</li>
											<li>Not Financially Aware / Inexperienced</li>
											<li>Cannot afford to hire an accountant</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Why do users need this?</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Legally required to file taxes</li>
											<li>Taxes for the first time can be confusing to your average person</li>
											<li>Even experienced tax-doers can ease the process with this tool and perhaps learn something new</li>
										</ul>
									<li>How will we collect information</li>
										<ul>
											<li>We will visit Greentown Labs to interview startup groups. (Ideally 10)</li>
										</ul>
									<li>What do these users want out of our service</li>
										<ul>
											<li>A way to files taxes easily and accurately</li>
											<li>Somwhere users can keep track of their finances(revenue, income, spending, etc.)</li>
										</ul>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<p>
								<b>Maybes:</b>
									<ul>
										<li>What legal counsels/details should be taken into account for the actual implementation. (Possibly out of scope, but useful for context)</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>How will your team work together to accomplish these goals (as well as your individual learning goals)?</h3>
							<br>
								As a design team, we plan to do most of our work in person as a team. We plan on
								collaborating mostly in the class time we have, but we also set up a when2meet to meet
								at least once a week outside of class. We agreed to meet every Sunday at 11am to get
								brunch and get some work done together.
								<br>
								<br>
								Although it is not our preferred way of working, we also set up a chat on the UXD
								Discord for online collaboration and general chats for any progress updates we need to
								be aware of and complete
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>Individual Learning Goals:</h3>
								<br>
							
								<b>Daniel:</b> To build upon what I learned in Collaborative Design last semester and get
								more familiar with wireframing and designing on Figma in a team setting.
								<br>
								<br>

								<b>Hardik:</b>To learn the principles of UX design through various iterations and user testing.
								Build a project that is usable, useful, and fun!
								<br>
								<br>

								<b>Nabih:</b>Build upon what I learned in UOCD and hopefully extend that a little bit into
								actual prototypes that can be used (since my UOCD was online we didn’t have much of
								this. Work on design and organizing data and information in ways that are easy to
								process.
								<br>
								<br>

								<b>Oscar:</b>Expand my website design knowledge to be able to accommodate
								user-feedback accordingly, and not to the best of my ability only. As well as push myself
								in user-research and interviewing skills.
								<br>
								<br>

								<b>Sush:</b> My learning goal for this semester in User Experience Design is to apply the
								skills and tools we learned during Collaborative Design. I would like to take this class as
								an opportunity to make our own design decisions where we use tools as we see fit
								instead of following a set rubric. I would also like to work on the development of
								front-end intersection designs with users. I can see this either being in the form of
								co-designs, or applying development rules for aesthetics

							<h2>Needs Analysis</h2>
							<p>
								Receipt Tracking for People, centered on Freelancers and Content Creators
							</p>
						</header>

						<p>
							<h3>What problem are you proposing to solve</h3>
							<br>
								Individuals who are self-employed or work in industries that are not formally recognized have a hard time understanding, tracking, and filing their taxes. Most of 
								the time these individuals are creatives and do not have any tools to understand what tax laws and brackets apply to them. Moreover, they do not take advantage of 
								the specific tax returns or write offs that may be available to them. And even if they are aware of the system, they need to keep track of their daily expenses and 
								understand how to divide personal expenses from business expenses. This is often done right before the tax deadlines, where you submit all the receipts you can get 
								your hands on to a tax consultant and wait for them to figure out what your final tax amount will be. However, many creatives/freelancers who are starting out do 
								not have the financial means to have an inhouse tax consultant.
								<br>
								<br> 
								Apart from the logistical issues, there is also a primary behavioral issue where individuals focused on creative work overlook their financial obligations. Building 
								an app catered specifically to this persona will provide them with an easy method to fulfill those responsibilities and, eventually, modify their behavior. 					
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>Who matters?</h3>
							<br>
								Individuals who are independent creators/freelancers and are at a stage where they do not require or cannot afford external help. They currently do not have any tools that 
								specifically satisfy their unique needs.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>How do your prospective users think about this problem/activity?</h3>
							<br>
								We think the core problem is not knowing how your expenses and income look like over time, and how that reflects onto your taxes. They are worried about budgeting accurately 
								and making the payments in time. Often, they are people who want to focus on their craft and do not want to deal with the finances of their enterprise. Our design aims to fix 
								that with easy to view solutions through graphs and easily digestible boxes of information.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>What requirements must your solution satisfy? (think about different stakeholders)</h3>
							<br>
								Our solution needs to solve a handful of critical issues to be viable. Primary of which is the ability to track and classify income. Individuals with multiple income sources or 
								a singular volatile source need the ability to automatically classify their income and consolidate it into small statements month over month. Secondly, a feature that can read 
								income and expense receipts to suggest tax write-offs.  And finally, we need to compile all the recorded info into a report that can be directly used to file taxes.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>What will the impact of a successful solution be?</h3>
							<br>
							A successful solution will help take the stress off of tax reporting day and instill healthy financial behaviors in our users. Moreover, a successful system  should also allow our 
							users to focus on what matters to them and focus on building their work.
						</p>

						<p>
							<h3>Narrative:</h3>
								<br>
								One of the commonalities we found during our interviews was that stress levels for the people is highly dependent on the type of income that our stakeholder earns. There are 
								several people who fir the Confidence Corey persona and require minimal help as they have established processes or have the means to get help. But on the flip side there are 
								individuals like Bewildered Benny, who does not have a constant flow of income, it is hard to have a set monthly budget and put aside income for taxes.  Then there are Future 
								Francis' who recognize that their current methods will only last so long and will require some help to transition from a manual process to a digital one. Our learning was that 
								it is these individuals who have a lack of tools and help from the market. Current software's are catered towards fixed income individuals and only help give general guidelines 
								to those with volatile income sources.
								<br>
								<br>

								Our goal would be to design a solution that helps educate our stakeholders about the budgeting and tax processes. This will be done dually, first with directly helping them record 
								and keep track of their income and expenses. Secondly, by giving actionable suggestions that are AI driven and make the tax process easier for them. With action and reinforcement
								we can help our users feel empowered about their finances and feel confident and being in charge of them.
