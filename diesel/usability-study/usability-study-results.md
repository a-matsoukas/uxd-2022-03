# Formal Usability Study Results

To test the icon navigation bar, we measured how long each user took to go from the “About Us” page to the “Login” page using the navigation bar. Here, user A was, at first, confused as to the difference between the application’s “Sign Up” icon and “Login” icon. They believed that the “Sign Up” icon closely resembled that of an “add friend” symbol, and thought the button of the interface was unintuitive. This user recommended that we should combine the “Sign Up” and “Login” pages, to create a more consolidated design. User B noted that the icon navigation bar was better than many websites for its simplicity; they don’t like having to press “the hamburger button” to drop down the navigation menu. They took the same amount of time to navigate from one page to another with icons and words.To test the word navigation bar, we measured how long each user took to go from the “Job Listings” page to the “Find” page using the navigation bar. Here, both users felt that the interface was very intuitive. User A did note, however, that they thought the text was a little small, but they were able to use the navigation bar efficiently nonetheless. User B had no issues navigating between the two pages, as they simply clicked the “Find” button.

In one of our experiments User A was able to navigate from the “About Us” to “Log In” in about 30 seconds using the navigation bar that featured iconography. Whereas the same user was able to navigate from “Job Listings” to “Find,” using the word navigation bar, in about 5 seconds. On the other hand, user B was able to reach their destination page in 7 seconds regardless of the use of icons or words.
Our response variable was time; the navigation bar with icons took an average of 18.5 seconds to navigate from one page to another, while the navigation bar with words took an average of six seconds. If these results held with a larger participant pool, it would be an indication that the navigation bar with words is much more understandable than those with icons. However, it’s important to consider the demographics and experiences of our users; if the user base was made up primarily of people whose second language was English or who were otherwise unfamiliar with the language, our usability test results might be reversed or much different. 

Based on the results of our study, we have decided to use our text based navigation bar. The icons that we chose were too open to interpretation and slowed users down as they tried to figure out what each icon meant (rather than focusing on completing the task at hand). We plan on responding to user feedback by making our text more legible by increasing the font size.
