# Adögi - Design Development
### By: Pris, Tolu, Hannah, Walter, and Jaclyn

*** 
## 1. Portfolio of design ideas:

Following several rounds of synthesizing observations from the previous stages of the design development process, our team decided to focus on creating ‘Adögi’, a mobile/web application that helps remove some of the barriers that currently exist in the world of pet adoption. The name ‘Adögi’ comes from a combination of ‘adoptee' and ‘dog’, with the umlaut playing into the app logo to make the face of a furry friend.

In terms of preliminary design ideas, our group opted to journal a few key ideas that we thought would be integral to the user experience of the app. Some features we kept top of mind were a streamlined onboarding process, an intuitive UI, and a platform that offered continued utility even after a user found and successfully adopted their dream pet. Keeping all of this in mind we began exploring different mobile app categories to determine which would be the best way to manifest our solution. During this analysis some of the categories we found to be particularly interesting were dating apps because of their ability to foster intimate relationships, social media apps because of their ability to build communities of various sizes, and AR/VR apps because of their high level of intractability.

## 2. Refine and Selection  

With a newfound direction for where we wanted our app to go we began to create several sketches of what the Adögi app could look like. At this point it was clear to us that creating an app where the user could find their animal companion was integral to our analysis of if we were truly meeting our users’ needs. As was mentioned previously, our three major sources of inspiration during this phase of the process came from dating apps like Tinder, social media apps like instagram, and AR/VR apps like Pokemon Go.

## 3. Identify Approach

After discussing the pros and cons of each methodology we collectively came to the conclusion that the methodology that would offer the most utility to the user would be that of the dating apps. Knowing this, we decided to hash out multiple sketches for this methodology. Multiple members of the team also spent some time during this stage of the design process to familiarize themselves with apps like Tinder, Buble, and Hinge to get a better understanding of the best features that we could either interpolate into or iterate upon for the Adögi app.

## 4. Interaction flow/storyboard:

With a clearer understanding of what we wanted to implement into our app, we took to Miro to develop our rough interaction flow of how the onboarding and pet browsing processes would look like. As was mentioned earlier, we wanted to give the user a streamlined experience that minimized pain points that are commonplace with conventional app onboarding processes. To do this we took some inspiration from platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Reddit. These platforms allow users to enjoy the features of the platform passively (such as viewing posts/videos) for as long as they wish to, and when the user eventually feels inclined enough to set up an account they become a more active consumer (such as gaining the abilities to like, comment, and follow).
The interaction flow below illustrates the path a user (person looking to adopt a pet) goes through the initial onboarding/browsing/reach out phase:

## 5. Low-fi paper prototype

We decided to implement a flip-book style paper prototype to showcase the different interactions the user can choose and flip to the corresponding page. Each page is outlined with what a phone would have (ie size, data, battery) to roughly capture the experience of actually using the phone. For smaller interactions (clicking a button that lights up, changing display of old pets to new pets), we used transparent film to represent changes in atoms. We went through multiple iterations of the paper prototype, starting with index cards and sketches to stock paper and sticky notes, to better convey the experience

## 6. Test with users

We did in-person focus group sessions where the user would flip through the paper prototype and ask clarifying questions or give feedback on parts of the design at a time. We walked them through the process of each screen and allowed them to interact on their own, after explaining the purpose of the app. We took notes on what questions they asked and the feedback they gave.

***
## 7. Test results
(a) Our design is a mobile application platform that connects those who want to adopt pets with those looking to rehome pets and/or put them up for adoption. The mission behind our app is to promote the notion of “adopt, don’t shop” and deter consumers from buying from unethical breeders. 

(b) Our app, Adögi, follows the business and application model of typical dating apps, most notably Tinder and Hinge, so that the tedious adoption process is synthesized into a thoughtful swiping process. By condensing typical adoption application questions to selectable “bubbles” that are a part of the onboarding process, it removes the friction preventing potential pet owners from following through with traditional adoption processes. Swiping to “like” or “love” pets is only available to users who have completed their profile, and users looking to rehome pets may only swipe on users who have “liked” or “loved” their pets first to minimize breaches in privacy. “Liking,” or swiping right, allows users to notify pet owners that they are interested in their pets and adds them to the queue of users on the pet owners’ end, and “loving,” by holding down the like button, a pet allows potential pet owners to be placed at the front of the queue. Both of these options are limited in how many “likes” and “loves” may be given out in a day to ensure thoughtful swiping. Swiping left, or clicking the “skip” button, puts the pet at the end of the rotational pet profile queue. Users may search by location, and filter by the species and breed of pet that they are interested in. Once a formal “request to adopt” has been sent, consented portions of the potential adopter’s profile will be sent to the pet owners upon request to foster trust between pet adopters and pet owners while maintaining user privacy. 

(c) Our app fills the opportunity gap presented by spontaneous COVID pet owners who no longer have the capability to care for their pets, and overpopulation of pet shelters that may result in the euthanization of animals. Many users also wish to rescue or adopt pets, but are deterred by shelters’ tedious applications, background checks, and home visits. After initial usability testing with members in our target market that have experience adopting, buying, and giving away pets, some key aspects our app falls short and need to consider include: more detailed onboarding questions, additional resource pages, and credibility concerns regarding potential adopters. A few testers wanted more detailed information from potential adopters, including the size of their living environment and the reasons for adopting. Potential first-time adopters worried about their personal shortcomings when caring for a pet for the first time, and hoped for a resource hub that could provide suggestions, resources, and care guides. The same population also wanted help selecting what pet may interest them best so they would not be as overwhelmed when swiping initially, describing simple personality-based questionnaires that matched them with compatible breeds. Finally, many pet owners wanted to ensure the credibility of those who wished to adopt their pets through background checks or recommendation letters similar to the dog-walking app Wag’s application process.


(d) Originally, we were considering a full scale adoption app that would go through the application and acceptance phase of adoption as well. However, as we talked with more users and people from the industry, we learned that the searching period was the longest and most tedious section of the entire adoption process. We decided to focus our energy into making the searching phase fun, inspiring and informative for the prospective and current pet owners. While further developing our Adögi app, we tinkered with the different options the user can interact with. Originally, we wanted to have 4 options: Love, Like, Skip, and Remove. We were trying to justify each interaction and found that Skip and Remove serve very similar functions and that Remove further narrows the options the user has. Therefore we decided to remove the Remove option and use Skip instead whenever the user feels indifferent or strongly against the presented pet. 


(e) When designing our brief, a key insight was to keep in mind the habits and behaviors of our target audience in order to design an app that they could understand and use seamlessly. We did not want to accidentally add more friction to the adoption process and impede our goals. To do so, we learned to consider how a non-technical user would approach the app, and to design with their priorities in mind rather than ours. This shift in thought processes helped us remove interaction flows that would be useless to end users, such as the “Remove” option and designing pages to be easily digestible, such as the pet owners’ “Liked” section. When considering end user’s interactions, we realized users would most likely click “Remove” over “Skip,” if given the option, which would exhaust the location-based cycle of profiles eventually and post problems. Likewise, we realized that users would rather see profiles in a grid format where portions of the profile could be “previewed” rather than a repetitive list format. By prioritizing consumer needs, making such decisions allowed us to develop the best experience to achieve our target consumers’ goals, independent of what additional features we assumed could benefit users and would instead hinder the process.

## Conclusion: 

After going through the design development process for Adögi, we, as a team have come away with a more holistic understanding of all the features that we believe would offer the greatest level of value to our users. Through market research, user interviews, group deliberations, and more, we are all very much excited for the next stage of development for Adögi, and truly believe that we are on the verge of creating something that could bring a lot of good into the world. Our next steps will include reviewing the feedback from our usability testers and integrating their feedback and concerns into our app. We will design ways to mitigate the more detailed onboarding questions, additional resource pages, and credibility concerns regarding potential adopters that our testers brought up, and continue to put user priorities and behavioral habits first when designing these aspects. Moving forward, we will also further develop the pet owner’s side of the app by delving into the psychology behind rehoming pets to create a pet-safe environment that ensures the sound mind of pet owners.

# Adögi - Design Refinement Submission
### By: Pris, Tolu, Hannah, Walter, and Jaclyn

*** 
## 1. What is your design? How does it work?

As was mentioned in the previous stages, our design for the Adogi app takes a substantial amount of influence from dating apps such as Tinder, and considering this we aimed to follow most of the conventions that dating apps tend to be built by, such as the “swipe right means yes and swipe left means no” feature that is so common to these apps. Additionally keeping in mind that we wanted to aim for a streamlined onboarding process we also took the time to design out two different incarnations of what an expedited onboarding experience would look like for a user looking to adopt a pet. We initially believed that the user experience we created was fairly intuitive, and by most metrics it was, but between the move from paper prototypes to Figma flows, we had to abstract some of our original concepts. 


Following several rounds of synthesizing observations from the previous stages of the design development process, our team decided to focus on creating ‘Adögi’, a mobile/web application that helps remove some of the barriers that currently exist in the world of pet adoption. The name ‘Adögi’ comes from a combination of ‘adoptee' and ‘dog’, with the umlaut playing into the app logo to make the face of a furry friend.

*** 
## 2. What changed (especially: between paper prototyping and the proposed final design), and why did you change it?

The primary thing that changed from our paper prototype to our final design was the idea of having a user have a “Like” section where they would be able to see the pets that they matched too. We realized that this was something that was unnecessary to the user experience of the adopter. In addition, we made the change of having an entry point to submit a dog adoption application from the chat user interface. This intentionally limits the user to not spam adoption requests to random pet owners who are putting their pets up for adoption. Additionally, a change we made can be seen on the chat feature, where by clicking the information icon, users can view the pet’s profile, giving users easy access to seeing who they have matched with from the chat interface. This change was made because we realized that this feature was a standard across existing matching apps, and that if a user needed to exit the chat to view their likes, it would add friction to the process. We also added the ability to view owner’s profiles from the pet profile so that pet adopters can build trust with the users behind the pet, and also browse other pet listings if the owner is posting on behalf of a shelter. 


*** 
## 3. Trade-offs to turning to online:

When it came to moving from the paper prototypes to the digital interpretation on Figma a few of the tradeoffs that we experienced related to how the flows became more tedious to demonstrate. Despite now having more realistic representation of what the final product would look like there was an unignorable learning curve with navigating how different key interface attributes would translate to this new medium. Because of this the model that we were able to get feedback from during the heuristic evaluation stage leaked features such as (such as swiping). In addition to this it became harder to visualize the undo/previous buttons and any possible animations/keyframes involved with the buttons we intended to create. This could be chalked up to the learning curve issue, and we intend to take the time to research how these more novel features could be implemented (similarly as to how we were able to accomplish key reames with transparencies during the paper prototype phase). Lastly due to the fact that we were essentially building the plane as we flew, remembering to give the user freedom was something we fell short of doing as we were focused on the linear workflow of signing up, to getting onboarded, to browsing for different pets.

When refining our prototype, we decided to move from a paper prototype to a digital prototype hosted in Figma for a higher fidelity prototype. There were 2 main trade-offs we committed to because of this switch. The first one was that the flows were more tedious to demonstrate in Figma but we get more realistic interactions with buttons and clicks. The realistic interaction was one of the important reasons why we decided to pursue a more hi-fi prototype. The second trade-off was it was difficult to remember to give users freedom on a digital prototype. On a paper prototype, the user can always flip to any page they want if they get stuck. On a digital prototype, the user can’t easily get out of being stuck unless we have fully implemented a strong set of undo/back buttons. It was harder for us as designers to visualize when the user needed undo/back buttons.

## 4. What key insights did you gain during this phase? What evidence supports these insights?

One of the most interesting insights that we gained during this phase has been the importance of making certain experiences feel resemblant of popular apps while not having the same connotation as some of them. We were able to hear from the group that evaluated our app design that while some of our designs reminded them of the user experience of apps that they have used in the past, the similar interface design made them develop a certain bias towards our app’s purpose. From the feedback that we received, we understood that there was a difference between familiarity and similarity to the app’s UX and UI. While we wanted to make learning how to use the app seamless, we realized that our designs gave off the undesired connotations that come with using similar user experiences. We were advised to follow the sophistication of certain apps that do similar jobs as the ones we originally chose without having the negative connotations. 

Secondly, keeping our UX flows lightweight was an insight that while we had as a goal for our design creation we found to be critical to the outcome of our platform. The primary point of evidence to indicate that we still needed to work on this revolves around our feedback given in person from another team. 

Lastly, insights from the usability heuristics allowed us to craft better experiences. Keeping the usability heuristics in mind when designing these mobile screens when it came to being able to exit/have freedom in navigating our app was important to note since we were unable to identify gaps in our UX flows. We realized users wanted to see an overview of the information that we were presenting before diving into something, and finding the balance between adding another screen and making it feel lightweight is a challenge we will be phasing in the upcoming phase of iteration.

## 5. What questions do you have now about your project (i.e., are there things you would like to investigate)? What shortcomings are you aware of ?

We have many actionable steps that were consolidated from our feedback sessions, as well as general design critiques within the team, but one of the most pressing questions that we are trying to find the answer to revolves around adding more with having less. This is common when having a vast amount of information and processes. How do we retain the user’s attention throughout the onboarding phase? How do we limit drop off? Do we hide or show certain things in certain places? How do we indicate this to the user? At what time? These questions are points to think about when iterating upon our design, and we are glad we don’t have clear answers to them yet. By creating, testing, and critiquing more designs, we will be able to find a sweet spot in delivering a usable, informative, and enjoyable experience to our users.
