<h3 id="overall-evaluation">Overall Evaluation</h3>
<p>Little Tree‚Äôs ambition in designing an Augmented Reality shopping experience comes
with interesting ways to find out how sustainable certain grocery products are. Aspects of good
design that we noted were the visual design decision of making most of their screens have a fair
amount of transparency, a deep dive into understanding their users and creating personas, and
their innovative leaf and star system. Major hurdles that we encountered surrounded the user‚Äôs
inability to leave/exit certain flows, while also not informing users of their current state within the
app, causing confusion and frustration while navigating the experience.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-changes">Recommended Changes</h3>
<p>To tackle the user control and freedom and also error prevention during the user
experience of Little Trees, we recommend adding buttons or options that allow users to undo or
cancel important actions. To tackle the error prevention issue, we recommend adding more ‚Äúare
you sure?‚Äù or add more general status visibility on different options. To tackle the standards and
consistency issue, we recommend looking over the prototype and making sure that the
language and location stays the same when referring to an object/option. Lastly, to tackle the
persona issue, we are conflicted on this and feel that maybe a different approach of
tailoring/personalizing the shopping experience would be beneficial while still demonstrating the
research done.</p>

<li>H2 - Match between system and real world ‚Äì Severity 3.5 ‚Äì 5 (üñêÔ∏è) people found this</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Problem: Personas are too general to be realistic/helpful, negative connotations with description and persona creates bias.</li>
<li>Solution: We really like the research still. Maybe changing it to select certain traits of a persona to tailor the experience or changing it to questions that the user can answer?</li>

<li>With this first screen where the ‚ÄúWelcome to Little Trees AR‚Äù is presented, I try to find out more about the description of the platform by clicking the icons in the middle, yet there is no information that shows up.

<li>When viewing an item in the Explore flow (in this case, the Folgers Classic Roast), there is no clear signifier to exit out of the screen. Even though after clicking around I realized I had to press the same item again to close it out, it would be nice to be presented with a small ‚Äòx‚Äô to minimize this.</li>

<li>In your ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù flow, having the progression into the items that you select ‚ÄúDairy-&gt;Milk-&gt;Whole-&gt;Fairlife‚Äù visible to the user helps them understand where they are in the tree of options. I would consider having this visible to them as they make their selection.</li>

<li>There seems to be a disconnect from when you decide to ‚ÄúAdd an Item‚Äù on the bottom left to the point where you are presented to the screen with a bunch of options (Dairy, Produce, Meat, Bakery). This transition does not feel seamless; I feel like I am lost in a sea of options. There is no clear indication of where I am in the flow.</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>When I get to the ‚Äúwhat type of shopper are you‚Äù screen, there are blank labels that I have to click into to see what they are. I‚Äôm not sure if you want this to be left a mystery and have users simply click on who they vibe with the most, but I was a bit confused by this. It could be helpful to explicitly write out who means what rather than leaving filler text, and if the mysterious aspect is intentional I would just suggest to opt for something other than using ‚Äúxxx‚Äù due to the connotations associated with that term.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>[H1 Visibility of System Status] (S2)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I understand that the configuration/onboarding process has not been fully fleshed out yet, but I think it would be helpful to add some sort of progress bar to help the user know how deep into the configuration dialog tree they are when trying to find out what shopping archetype they best fit into.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>[H3 User Control and Freedom] (S3)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>When going through the configuration/onboarding process I realized that there was no real way to go back/up the dialog tree for figuring out what shopping archetype someone is. Now this could be intentional but if so I think that the user shouldn‚Äôt have their archetype determined at the beginning, but rather at the end after a series of questions. Either way the user still should be able to navigate between paths in the event that they change their minds.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>[H4 Consistency and Standards] (S1)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is a bit more nitpicky, but for the buttons I would try to maintain a consistency of either using only words, only using icons, or only using icons next to words within the buttons. Also more explicitly defining what ‚Äúy‚Äù and ‚Äún‚Äù mean would be helpful especially to those who are color blind and may not realize they are shorthand for ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù respectively.</li>

<li>I believe that having the ability to quickly add and remove priority items from your shopping inventory in under 2-3 taps/keystrokes would do the user a world of good, rather than needing to go through the menus to find something every time.</li>

</ol>
<ul>
<li>The first time I used the UI I accidentally closed out the modal in the top right, and was then no longer able to pull it up again. I would probably just chalk this up to the fact that I might have gone out of bounds for the user test, but I think that it would be helpful to have a confirmation popup appear when users are about to close out a modal that might be important.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li>[H4 Consistency and Standards] (S2)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>At first glance I thought that the text within the three item boxes at the top for the coffee, cereal, and tea were not properly aligned, but after second glance I realized that the two lines of text are center aligned based on the surrounding elements, but because of the different sizes of each product‚Äôs name it looks a bit off. I would suggest left-aligning the text in these boxes just so that it appears more aesthetically pleasing.</li>

<li>[H9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors] (S3)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As was mentioned before when I accidentally closed out some modals I was no longer able to get them back. I would try to add a way to recover modals that the user accidentally closed and just ensure that changes aren't permanent without the explicit consent of the user.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
<li>[H1 Visibility of System Status] (S2)</li>

<li>Similarly to the configuration flow I would suggest adding some sort of progress bar or indicator to help the user along with their shopping experience and keep track of what they need vs. what they have.</li>

<li>In terms of this I would just propose to make the iconography more intuitive. Check and ‚Äúx‚Äù marks are understandable but I think that in this case where you are developing something that has not really been done before, being deliberate about what buttons mean and do (with buttons labeled with words or icons next to words) would be helpful to the user in a space where conventions have not really been defined yet.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="11">
<li>[H8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design] (S1)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For this I would just advise to increase the contrast between the white text and gray modal backgrounds so that it is easier to read. On a computer screen I can read it alright but I‚Äôm not sure how it would map to a VR headset.</li>
