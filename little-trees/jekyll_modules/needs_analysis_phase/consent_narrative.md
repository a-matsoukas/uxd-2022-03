### Purpose
We are students from Olin College of Engineering and Babson College who are working on a project for User Experience Design (UXD), a course for designing and prototyping user-friendly software interfaces. We are hoping to increase accessibility to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and carbon footprint data to consumers to make more informed decisions in purchases and investments.

### Description
Our goal is to learn about your decision-making process when you choose which businesses to purchase items from and what considerations go into what you buy. We have some preliminary prototypes of an interface that allows consumers to explore how environmentally-friendly companies are and compare the carbon footprint of similar companies within many industry sectors. We are trying to get feedback on our designs.

### Techniques that may be used upon your Approval
To ensure that we make the most of the time we spend interviewing you, we may document the interview through notes, video, photo, and audio documentation. We are willing to accommodate the comforts of the individual we are interviewing; before using a documentation technique, we will ask you for permission. Privacy and confidentiality are important to us. We will make sure you are comfortable with the confidentiality of the information you are providing us.

### Confidentiality
Because we will document what we learn from you, we will protect your privacy by removing all identifying information from our records. The data collected will be used internally to improve our design, but no one outside of our team will have access to your personal information.

### Time Commitment
This course operates over the course of 4 months from September to December. We may reach out to you to schedule additional interviews, if you are willing to keep working with us; it depends on what direction our work will head in. Interviews should not last too long; they can go anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, depending on your schedule and the nature of the interview.

### Compensation
Although we are unable to provide monetary compensation, we will compensate in the form of gratitude :). You will be contributing to a more fulfilling and involved education for our team.
