### Heuristic Evaluation Response
#### Heuristic Violations of Level 3 or Higher
**H8 - Aesthetic and visual hierarchy - Severity 3 - 3 (ðŸ¤Ÿ) people found this** </br>
**Problem A**: Buttons and elements are grey, a color widely known to indicate an inactive/disabled state in design, hard to tell when one is toggled/pressed </br>
**Solution A**: differentiate when something is active vs inactive, finding another way to present notifications without having them blend into background

We chose not to fully address this heuristic issue because we felt that there were more severe functionality issues that impeded the use of our prototype that we should prioritize; therefore, the button and element colors are still gray in our more refined prototype. However, we worked to address the second point brought up in this heuristic violation regarding it being difficult to identify the state of toggles. The way we chose to address this violation was to increase opacity differences between active and inactive toggle states so that it is easier for the user to see the contrast between the toggle states. To be more consistent with other designs, the active state is the darker opacity, and the inactive state appears lighter.

**Problem B**: Shopping Cart and Toggle On/Off same through a visual hierarchy perspective </br>
**Solution B**:  Highlight whichever is more important/is the preferred action

We chose not to move the location of the shopping list in response to the visual hierarchy feedback. While we received a critique that the shopping list should appear higher up on the screen (perhaps in the upper right corner to be more consistent with e-commerce sites), we also had to consider how the menu is superimposed on the user's reality when they are moving through a store. Having the shopping list appear in the top corner of the screen in Figma likely means that the user will have to physically lift their head to see the items in their list. Keeping the shopping list closer to the user's eye level makes it more accessible in AR.




#### Additional Easily-Addressable Heuristic Violations
After addressing the more critical usability violations in our prototype, our team addressed some smaller and easily-addressable aesthetic and navigation items in our heuristic evaluation.</br>
One key issue that came up several times in our received feedback was the lack of transparency in where users are in certain shopping flows. We addressed this feedback by adding progress bars in two key places: the pre-shopping flow and the search flow.
Now, the user is able to see how much of the pre-shopping configuration is completed and how much is left, and they are also able to navigate around the search flow using the breadcrumbs at the top of the screen without being trapped in a one-way flow. </br>
Furthermore, our team refined the look of the onboarding and the pre-shopping screens to have more color as a first step in addressing the original gray color palette. Keeping with our theme of sustainability and our team name, the colors incorporated into the onboarding screens reflect the brown and green colors of the forest. Next steps will include introducing this color palette throughout the rest of the interface. </br>
Finally, we reduced the opacity of the superimposed popups on the screen in response to feedback that it is not easy enough to see what is behind the AR interface. Since the user's will be navigating in busy stores, it is important that they are able to see what is going on around them.


#### Using the Refined Prototype
Our Figma prototype is still functional and can be used for further testing. The usability directions for the prototype are mostly unaffected by the changes that we made during this phase; although usability and functionality has increased, there are still discrete sections of the interface that need to be further interconnected and developed. See the <a href="/uxd-2022-03/little-trees/design-refinement-phase/prototype-documentation/" class="normal_link">Prototype Documentation</a> for instructions on how to access and interface with the prototype, as well as context for the intended user group.
