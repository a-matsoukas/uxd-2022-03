How does it work?</h2><p>Our design seeks to make it easier for travelers with physical disabilities to learn about the accessibility of places they want to visit. Although this has slowly been improving in the past years, many existing establishments remain inaccessible to people with certain disabilities. Currently, the primary way people with mobility restrictions figure out if their needs will be met is by calling places. This can be burdensome and does not guarantee they will get all of the necessary information if any. Our design consists of an app that allows our users to view and discover places around their location, as well as their accessibility restrictions. The user also has the opportunity to answer a few questions that help our algorithm suggest only places that can accommodate their needs. Once an establishment is suggested, it will be possible to view a few of the location’s images, and the location info, as well as the reviews by other users of the app.</p><h2 id=what-changed-what-are-your-insights>What changed? What are your insights?</h2><p>We changed a lot about how the accessibility of places was rated, and how data input affected what places were recommended to the user. In our paper prototypes, we wanted to show that only certain recommendations were given to the user based on their accessibility profile. However, after conducting interviews with a few people who have physical disabilities, we learned that recommendations based on their accessibility data were not desired. Our users want to be able to assess whether or not they want to take the risk of going to a place that maybe isn’t as accessible. They described the system we had in place as “binding the user to their disability”. This was a major flaw in our interface that had to be fixed. Thus, when designing our Figma prototype, we decided to simply cut out the feature of recommending users a place based on their accessibility needs. Instead, places are recommended based on what the user wants to do with their travels.</p><p>To replace the benefits of this feature without adding back the negative implications, we added a few more features to our Figma prototype. In our prototype, we added pictures for each location, user reviews, and overall accessibility reviews for each location that are based on user reviews. This lets the user know what risks they would have to take to go to a certain location, which helps them prepare to travel there or decide if they even want to go.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/designrefinement/paperlocationdetail.png alt="Paper prototype of a location&amp;rsquo;s details" height=500px><figcaption><p>Paper prototype of a location&rsquo;s details</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/designrefinement/figmalocationdetail.png alt="Figma prototype of a location&amp;rsquo;s details" height=500px><figcaption><p>Figma prototype of a location&rsquo;s details</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/designrefinement/figmalocationsnapshot.png alt="Figma prototype of a location snapshot" height=500px><figcaption><p>Figma prototype of a location snapshot</p></figcaption></figure></th></tr></thead></table><p>In addition, putting the map function into Figma made it more helpful for us to envision what functionalities it can offer, such as moving around on the screen to explore surrounding areas, as well as zooming into a location (which we have yet to implement on Figma).</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/designrefinement/papermap.png alt="Paper prototype of the map view" height=500px><figcaption><p>Paper prototype of the map view</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/designrefinement/figmamap.png alt="Figma prototype of the map view" height=500px><figcaption><p>Figma prototype of the map view</p></figcaption></figure></th></tr></thead></table><h2 id=tradeoffs>Tradeoffs</h2><p>We decided not to add a feature that would show directions to the user. Instead, we added the option to view any location selected in a separate map app. While we think this feature could have added value to our app, we decided it was out of the scope of this project. There were also limitations to what could be quickly implemented in Figma, such as the ability to zoom in and out on a map. Although it would have been nice to include every feature we wanted to, it was important to prioritize getting usability feedback before overcomplicating the interface.</p><h2 id=questions>Questions</h2><p>From the heuristic evaluations that we received, while there were no “catastrophic violations” of the UI design, there were some “quick fix” or “quality-of-life” improvements that were brought to light that we hadn’t thought of or considered initially when making the Figma prototype. For example, the most glaring issue seemed to be that there was no indication that a user could swipe up on the Krusty Krab page and see more details about the establishment (this screen can be seen in the image below), which limits the user’s ability to access key functionality of the interface. It was also found that a user that is signing up for the first time is able to check that they have no mobility issues and that they have a series of mobility issues at the same time, which is bound to prevent users from being properly served by this interface. It would also be great to be able to go back to the core users of our app (people with mobility restrictions) to get their feedback again.</p><figure class=align-center><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/designrefinement/figmalocationsnapshot2.png alt="Figma prototype of a location snapshot" height=500px><figcaption><p>Figma prototype of a location snapshot</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=distribution-of-team-effort>Distribution of Team Effort</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Team member</strong></th><th><strong>Contribution notes</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Jacob</strong></td><td>My largest contributions were probably towards the website setup process and spending a solid amount of time fixing problems with it. For the prototype, I mostly worked on getting the map portion of the Figma prototype to work and look nice, which also involved making some custom vector icons.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Carlo</strong></td><td>I focused mostly on designing and creating some of the key flows and interactions, the Location’s Snapshot page (and location details), and worked on the general style of the app. This included creating the logos, choosing colors and fonts, and ensuring style and mood consistency throughout the prototype.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sree</strong></td><td>I did the Login, Sign Up, Saved, and Search portions of the Figma prototype, as well as the corresponding prototype flows for those. In addition, I was involved in the organizational aspects of the team and set up our out-of-class meeting times.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anna</strong></td><td>I felt like I was able to help a lot with details and overall design style in Figma. I had some experience with the small details of flows so I was able to fill some in that others missed. I also helped with the overall organization of our team and making sure we were on top of assignments.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max</strong></td><td>I had some experience with Figma and spent a lot of time on that. Specifically, I worked on the flow for the user profile and accessibility data input and logistics from the paper prototype to Figma. I also helped work on the aesthetics of our interface and keeping consistent visuals throughout, as well as helping with our website.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></section><footer id=footer><ul class=icons></ul><ul class=copyright></ul></footer></div><script src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/js/jquery.min.js></script>
