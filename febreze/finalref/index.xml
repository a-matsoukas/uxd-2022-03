As part of our process, we conducted a usability study to determine how our interface could be best. In the study, we held most aspects of the interface constant while changing one specific part. Then, we had users try out the different interfaces and collect data on the differences in user behavior between the two.
Motivation After our heuristic evaluation, we decided to put a large emphasis on the flow of our app and the ease of navigation between different frames in our interface.</description></item><item><title>Final Refinement Phase Submission</title><link>https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/finalrefinement/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 04:43:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/finalrefinement/</guid><description>Modifying Design &amp;amp; Implementing Changes In the design refinement stage, our modification process was driven by an overarching goal for our interface that we came up with as a team. We wanted our interface to be very smooth and efficient for the user to navigate through. With this in mind, we started modifying our interface by taking the feedback we got from our heuristic evaluation and making all necessary changes that hindered the usability of our interface.</description></item><item><title>Final Presentation and Figma Prototype</title><link>https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/presentation-prototype/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 04:43:25 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/presentation-prototype/</guid><description>Final Presentation At the end of the course, we delivered a presentation on our insights, which is embedded below.
