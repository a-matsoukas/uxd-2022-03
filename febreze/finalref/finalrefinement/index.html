We wanted our interface to be very smooth and efficient for the user to navigate through. With this in mind, we started modifying our interface by taking the feedback we got from our heuristic evaluation and making all necessary changes that hindered the usability of our interface. We then navigated through our interface multiple times, and fixed minor issues we found in testing and in our feedback. After arriving upon two iterations we were happy with, we began our A/B testing with users who had not previously seen our interface. We recorded very helpful data through our testing, and used this data to compare the two prototypes and properly refine our interface.</p><h3 id=addressing-heuristic-violations-level-3>Addressing Heuristic Violations (Level 3+)</h3><p>From the heuristic evaluations, we had two violations of Severity 4, and four violations of Severity 3.</p><h4 id=navigating-to-the-business-page-from-the-photo-carousel-1-visibility-of-system-status-severity-4>Navigating to the Business Page from the Photo Carousel [#1: Visibility of System Status] (Severity: 4)</h4><blockquote><p>After clicking on the Business Page, you are taken to a Photo Carousel. While the indicator on the bottom shows that there are multiple pictures to view, it does not indicate that you should swipe up for more information. Our group got caught up swiping in circles, unsure of how to advance. Adding an indicator to swipe up would make this easier to use.</p></blockquote><p>This was was one of the features that we tested with in our usability study, where we performed A/B testing with two new versions of a swipe indicator: one with a small up arrow, and the other with a bigger hand icon, as shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><div class="flex justify-center"><img src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/final1.png alt="The arrow version of the &amp;ldquo;swipe up&amp;rdquo; icon." style=max-width:42rem;max-height:32rem></div><div class=text-center><figcaption><p>The arrow version of the &ldquo;swipe up&rdquo; icon.</p></figcaption></div></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><div class="flex justify-center"><img src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/final2.png alt="The hand version of the &amp;ldquo;swipe up&amp;rdquo; icon." style=max-width:42rem;max-height:32rem></div><div class=text-center><figcaption><p>The hand version of the &ldquo;swipe up&rdquo; icon.</p></figcaption></div></figure></th></tr></thead></table><p>Our users were asked to find the &ldquo;Directions&rdquo; button, after which we timed how long it took for the user to realize they needed to swipe up from the location snapshot to view its details, and measured how many taps/interactions it took for them to get to the details page by eventually swiping up. We thought that it would be slightly more obvious that the user needs to swipe up with the larger indicator, making it faster for users to find this function, and by the end of the experiment, we were correct in this assumption. The old version of the prototype did not contain any sort of icon or indicator to swipe up, as brought up in this heuristic violation, so it was a bit unintuitive for users to figure out how to view the details of a certain location from the snapshot, hence why we decided to test this feature.</p><h4 id=potential-for-conflicting-input-5-error-prevention-severity-4>Potential for conflicting input [#5 Error Prevention] (Severity: 4)</h4><blockquote><p>When entering information during the sign up process there is the opportunity to enter conflicting information about your requirements (i.e. on the &ldquo;Do you need to avoid certain surfaces?&rdquo; page the user can select both &ldquo;no&rdquo; and other options. This could confuse the algorithm on the requirements that need to be met when selecting options. Adding some kind of preventative measure would make logical sense for this process.</p></blockquote><p>We fixed this by simplifying questions and adding a skip button users can choose instead of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;none&rdquo; in order to add preventative measures for conflicting input. This was another feature that we tested in our usability study, where we performed A/B testing with two versions of the personalization quiz: the old version without the skip button and progress bar, and the new version with both of these added. As expected, the version with these added features was preferred.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><div class="flex justify-center"><img src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/final3.png alt="Quiz question without skip button or progress bar." style=max-width:42rem;max-height:32rem></div><div class=text-center><figcaption><p>Quiz question without skip button or progress bar.</p></figcaption></div></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><div class="flex justify-center"><img src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/final4.png alt="Simplified question with added skip button and progress bar." style=max-width:42rem;max-height:32rem></div><div class=text-center><figcaption><p>Simplified question with added skip button and progress bar.</p></figcaption></div></figure></th></tr></thead></table><h4 id=saved-page-doesnt-have-direct-access-to-the-map-7-flexibility-and-efficiency-of-use-severity-3>&ldquo;Saved&rdquo; page doesn’t have direct access to the Map [#7 Flexibility and efficiency of use] (Severity: 3)</h4><blockquote><p>Users don’t have direct access to the map from the &ldquo;saved&rdquo; page which goes against the pattern recognition of the map being easily accessed from any page in the app.</p></blockquote><p>We added a Map button on the Saved page for the user to be able to directly access the map from the Saved page without having to go back to another page in order to access it.</p><figure><div class="flex justify-center"><img src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/final5.png alt="Added Map button on Saved page." style=max-width:42rem;max-height:32rem></div><div class=text-center><figcaption><p>Added Map button on Saved page.</p></figcaption></div></figure><h4 id=you-are-here-indicator-on-the-map-1-visibility-of-system-status-severity-3>You are here indicator on the Map [#1 Visibility of System Status] (Severity: 3)</h4><blockquote><p>Including a marker for users to know where they are relative to a location on a map would help them have a better understanding of where they are and how to get there.</p></blockquote><p>We added a pinpoint indicator on the map so that users are able to know where they currently are on the map, in order to facilitate their traveling.</p><figure><div class="flex justify-center"><img src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/finalref/final6.png alt="Added a &amp;ldquo;You are here&amp;rdquo; indicator on Map." style=max-width:42rem;max-height:32rem></div><div class=text-center><figcaption><p>Added a &ldquo;You are here&rdquo; indicator on Map.</p></figcaption></div></figure><h4 id=linking-between-krusty-krab-back-button-and-map-page-1-visibility-of-system-status-3-user-control-and-freedom-severity-3>Linking between Krusty Krab Back Button and Map Page [#1 Visibility of System Status, #3 User Control and Freedom] (Severity: 3)</h4><blockquote><p>After clicking on the Krusty Krab business page from the Home page, we tried to exit using the back button. Instead of being taken back to the Home page as expected, we were taken to the Map page. This design feature made it feel like the interface had imposed an action on the user and had decided that we should continue looking for places in the area.</p></blockquote><p>This was fixed such that when users click on a business page from the home page and then hit the back button, they are routed back to the home page rather than the map.</p><h4 id=hidden-ratings-4-consistency-and-standards-severity-3>Hidden ratings [#4 Consistency and Standards] (Severity: 3)</h4><blockquote><p>Highlight the rating a bit more on the page since users will care about rating most after accessibility concerns.</p></blockquote><p>We decided to not fix the above issue because this was very similar to another one that we had fixed before, related to ratings and aesthetics. Hence, we believe we tackled this problem already.</p><p>We also decided not to add a feature that would show directions to the user. Instead, we added the option to view any location selected in a separate map app. While we think this feature could have added value to our app, we decided it was out of the scope of this project. There were also limitations to what could be quickly implemented in Figma, such as the ability to zoom in and out on a map. Although it would have been nice to include every feature we wanted to, it was important to prioritize getting usability feedback before overcomplicating the interface.</p><p>There were also some minor aesthetic changes that we decided not to pursue because we did not agree with the feedback team.</p><h2 id=distribution-of-team-effort>Distribution of Team Effort</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Team member</strong></th><th><strong>Contribution notes</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Jacob</strong></td><td>I did a lot of work on the website again - I migrated us to a new theme, which was a significant undertaking, but turned out well. For the prototype, I refined the map screen.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Carlo</strong></td><td>I focused mostly on designing and creating some of the key flows and interactions, the Location’s Snapshot page (and location details), and worked on the general style of the app. This included creating the logos, choosing colors and fonts, and ensuring style and mood consistency throughout the prototype. I also worked modifying our Figma prototype to incorporate both heuristic feedback and feedback from users.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sree</strong></td><td>I contributed mainly to the submission write-ups and edits as well as minor Figma fixes. In addition, I was involved in the organizational aspects of the team (such as outlining the final presentation and delegating slides) and set up our out-of-class meeting times.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anna</strong></td><td>I felt like I was able to help a lot with details and overall design style in Figma. I had some experience with the small details of flows so I was able to fill some in that others missed. I also helped with the overall organization of our team and making sure we were on top of assignments. Otherwise, we all contributed to our final presentation and this final write up equally.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max</strong></td><td>I worked on sifting through all of our heuristic evaluation feedback and coming up with ideas for how we could address some of the places we fell short with our prior prototype. I also helped make the changes in figma and conduct testing on all of the changes.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></main><footer class=bg-tlgray-100><script src=/uxd-2022-03/febreze/js/clipboard.min.js></script>
