In the study, we held most aspects of the interface constant while changing one specific part. Then, we had users try out the different interfaces and collect data on the differences in user behavior between the two.</p><h3 id=motivation>Motivation</h3><p>After our heuristic evaluation, we decided to put a large emphasis on the flow of our app and the ease of navigation between different frames in our interface. Initially, we wanted to keep our interface relatively minimalistic and not crowded with too many icons or directives. However, this lead to users being confused at certain stages of navigation through our interface. Therefore, we focused our attention on striking a balance between minimalist, sleek aesthetics and obvious directions regarding navigation for the user.</p><h3 id=study-plan>Study Plan</h3><p>We performed A/B testing on our personalization quiz and location snapshot page. In each version, the user completed the same tasks with the same directions given. We set out to test at least four people, all of whom had not seen our prototype before and would be seeing it with a fresh set of eyes. We ended up testing with exactly four people. Two of the people will saw prototype 1 first and the other two saw prototype 2 first. This is because we hypothesized that the speed would likely be impacted by seeing a similar prototype a second time.</p><h4 id=personalization-quiz>Personalization Quiz</h4><p>The quiz had one version with a progress tracker, a skip question button, one simplified multiple choice question, and swipe functionality, while the other version did not have these features. Our hypothesis was that it would take a shorter amount of time (likely a few seconds) for users to go through the quiz with these additional features. They had set answers for the questions. We observed the speed of each task and if the user made any errors along the way (such as accidentally going to the next quiz question).</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/quiz_noskip_progress.jpg alt="Old version of the quiz UI" height=500px><figcaption><p>Old version of the quiz UI</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/quiz_skip_progress.jpg alt="Newer version of the quiz UI with skip and progress bar" height=500px><figcaption><p>Newer version of the quiz UI with skip and progress bar</p></figcaption></figure></th></tr></thead></table><h4 id=location-snapshot>Location Snapshot</h4><p>For the location snapshot, we used two versions: one with the small up arrow, and one with the bigger hand icon. Our users were asked to find the “Directions” button. We measured how long it took the user to realize they needed to swipe up from the location snapshot to view its details, and measured how many taps/interactions it took for them to get to the details page by eventually swiping up. We thought it would be slightly more obvious the user needed to swipe up with the larger indicator, making it faster for users to find this function. Similarly to the personalization quiz, we observed the users’ speeds and monitored for errors such as trying to get to the directions button through not swiping up. The old version of the prototype did not contain any sort of icon or indicator to swipe up, so it was a bit unintuitive for users to figure out how to view the details of a certain location from the snapshot, hence why we decided to test this feature.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/locationsnapshot_arrow.jpg alt="Location snapshot with arrow icon" height=500px><figcaption><p>Location snapshot with arrow icon</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/locationsnapshot_hand.jpg alt="Location snapshot with hand icon" height=500px><figcaption><p>Location snapshot with hand icon</p></figcaption></figure></th></tr></thead></table><h4 id=results-personalization-quiz>Results: Personalization Quiz</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center></th><th style=text-align:center><strong>Version A (Progress tracker etc.)</strong></th><th style=text-align:center><strong>Version B (No progress tracker etc.)</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Tester 1</td><td style=text-align:center>50 sec</td><td style=text-align:center>38 sec</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Tester 2</td><td style=text-align:center>43 sec</td><td style=text-align:center>45 sec</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Average</td><td style=text-align:center>46.5 sec</td><td style=text-align:center>41.5 sec</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In testing the personalization quiz, we found that on average, users got through the non-multiple choice quiz without a question tracker five seconds faster than the individual input quiz with question tracker. However, most of our users that we tested with said that they liked the slower quiz more, and felt that it was much more intuitive than the multiple choice option.</p><p>Testing on a larger population would allow us to gather more data and understand if the averages are so close because of similar intuitiveness or for some other factors, allowing us to make a more informed decision when moving forwards with one of the two.</p><h4 id=results-location-snapshot>Results: Location Snapshot</h4><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center></th><th style=text-align:center><strong>Version A (Arrow icon)</strong></th><th style=text-align:center><strong>Version B (Hand icon)</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Tester 1</td><td style=text-align:center>3 sec</td><td style=text-align:center>2 sec</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Tester 2</td><td style=text-align:center>12 sec</td><td style=text-align:center>1 sec</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Average</td><td style=text-align:center>7.5 sec</td><td style=text-align:center>1.5 sec</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Upon a first pass through our location snapshot prototype, when presented with the arrow indicator, it took the users an average time of 7.5 seconds to figure out they needed to swipe up. With the hand icon, it only took users an average of 1.5 seconds to figure out that they needed to swipe up. While the sample size isn&rsquo;t large, the data we have shows that the hand icon contributes a much more intuitive user experience.</p><p>If our product was to be tested on a larger population, we would most likely find that people associate a swipe up action with a hand more than just with an arrow. Therefore, it would be best for us to use this icon to improve the intuitiveness and clarity of our interface.</p><h3 id=what-next>What next?</h3><p>Based on the results of this usability study, the quiz with the multiple choice question and progress tracker was preferred and the swipe up indicator of a hand was more clear to users. Therefore, all of these preferred features will be included in our final prototype. If we had more time, we would have liked to add additional features our users brought up such as, more clear selection indicators on the quiz and making the map button more visible. While we don’t have the ability to make every change we want, these suggestions are valuable for our learning.</p></div></section><footer id=footer><ul class=icons></ul><ul class=copyright></ul></footer></div><script src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/js/jquery.min.js></script>
