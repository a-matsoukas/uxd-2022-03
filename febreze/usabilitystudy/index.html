In the study, we hold most aspects of the interface constant while changing one specific part. Then, we have users try out the different interfaces and collect data on the differences in user behavior between the two.</p><h3 id=motivation>Motivation</h3><p>After our heuristic evaluation, we decided to put a large emphasis on the flow of our app and the ease of navigation between different frames in our interface. Initially, we wanted to keep our interface relatively minimalistic and not crowded with too many icons or directives. However this lead to users being confused at certain stages of navigation through our interface. Therefore, we are focusing our attention on striking a balance between minimalist, sleek aesthetics and obvious directions regarding navigation for the user.</p><h3 id=study-plan>Study Plan</h3><p>We are going to perform A/B testing on our personalization quiz and location snapshot page. In each version, the user will complete the same tasks with the same directions given. We will ideally test at least four people, all of whom have not seen our prototype before and will be seeing it with a fresh set of eyes. Two of the people will see prototype 1 first and the other two will see prototype 2 first. This is because the speed will likely be impacted by seeing a similar prototype a second time.</p><h4 id=personalization-quiz>Personalization Quiz</h4><p>The quiz will have one version with a progress tracker, a skip question button, one simplified multiple choice question, and swipe functionality, while the other version will not have these features. Our hypothesis is that it will take a shorter amount of time (likely a few seconds) for users to go through the quiz with these additional features. They will have set answers for the questions. We will observe the speed of each task and if the user makes any errors along the way (such as accidentally going to the next quiz question).</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/quiz_noskip_progress.jpg alt="Old version of the quiz UI" height=500px><figcaption><p>Old version of the quiz UI</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/quiz_skip_progress.jpg alt="Newer version of the quiz UI with skip and progress bar" height=500px><figcaption><p>Newer version of the quiz UI with skip and progress bar</p></figcaption></figure></th></tr></thead></table><h4 id=location-snapshot>Location Snapshot</h4><p>For the location snapshot, we would be using two versions: one with the small up arrow, one with the bigger hand icon. Our users will be asked to find the “Directions” button. We would like to measure how long it takes the user to realize they need to swipe up from the location snapshot to view its details, and measure how many taps/interactions it takes for them to get to the details page by eventually swiping up. We think it will be slightly more obvious the user needs to swipe up with the larger indicator, making it faster for users to find this function. Similarly to the personalization quiz, we will be observing the users’ speeds and monitoring for errors such as trying to get to the directions button through not swiping up. The old version of the prototype did not contain any sort of icon or indicator to swipe up, so it was a bit unintuitive for users to figure out how to view the details of a certain location from the snapshot, hence why we decided to test this feature.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/locationsnapshot_arrow.jpg alt="Location snapshot with arrow icon" height=500px><figcaption><p>Location snapshot with arrow icon</p></figcaption></figure></th><th style=text-align:center><figure><img src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze//images/usabilitystudy/locationsnapshot_hand.jpg alt="Location snapshot with hand icon" height=500px><figcaption><p>Location snapshot with hand icon</p></figcaption></figure></th></tr></thead></table></div></section><footer id=footer><ul class=icons></ul><ul class=copyright></ul></footer></div><script src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/js/jquery.min.js></script>
